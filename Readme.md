# MEEN20010 \'97 Introduction to Fluid Mechanics for Engineers \'96 University College Dublin\
Dr. Kevin Nolan\
\
These notebooks comprise about half of an introductory fluid mechanics course covering material on hydrostatics, kinematics, Bernoulli's equation and control volume analysis.\
\
The majority of the videos are made using Blender and the FLIP addon.\
Rudimentary Interactive 3D models are displayed using PyGEL3D\
\
The remainder of the course will follow in the 2020/2021 academic year.\
\
If you're new to Jupyter have a look at the Setup Guide html which will guide you through setting up the required software on your computer. \
\
If you just want to view the notebook files I recommend nbviewer on jupyter.org\
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nolankucd/MEEN20010/tree/master/\
\
You can launch a binder session from there if you would like to edit a copy of your selected notebook.\
Google Colab also works but it doesn't always display the multimedia content.\
\
You can also download/clone the repository and run the html files locally in your browser - note that the html pages look for the media directory so keep everything as downloaded.\
