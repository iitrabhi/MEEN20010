# MEEN20010 — Introduction to Fluid Mechanics for Engineers – University College Dublin
Dr. Kevin Nolan

These notebooks comprise about half of an introductory fluid mechanics course covering material on hydrostatics, kinematics, Bernoulli's equation and control volume analysis.

The majority of the videos are made using Blender and the FLIP addon.
Rudimentary Interactive 3D models are displayed using PyGEL3D

The remainder of the course will follow in the 2020/2021 academic year.

If you're new to Jupyter have a look at the Setup Guide html which will guide you through setting up the required software on your computer. 

If you just want to view the notebook files I recommend nbviewer on jupyter.org
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nolankucd/MEEN20010/tree/master/

You can launch a binder session from there if you would like to edit a copy of your selected notebook.
Google Colab also works but it doesn't always display the multimedia content.

You can also download/clone the repository and run the html files locally in your browser - note that the html pages look for the media directory so keep everything as downloaded.
