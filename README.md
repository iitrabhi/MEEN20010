# MEEN20010 — Introduction to Fluid Mechanics for Engineers – University College Dublin
Dr. Kevin Nolan

These notebooks comprise about half of an introductory fluid mechanics course covering material on hydrostatics, kinematics, Bernoulli's equation and control volume analysis.

The majority of the videos are made using Blender and the FLIP addon.
Rudimentary Interactive 3D models are displayed using PyGEL3D

The remainder of the course will follow in the 2020/2021 academic year.
